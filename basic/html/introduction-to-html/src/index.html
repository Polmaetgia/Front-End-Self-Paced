            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Summarizing information is a crucial skill, particularly in academic and professional settings. 
                It involves condensing a larger body of text or data into a shorter, 
                digestible form while retaining the core messages and essential details. 
                This process requires analytical thinking to determine what is most important in the original content.
            </p>
            <p>
                Effective summaries enable clearer communication, as they distill complex information into more accessible insights. 
                They are often used to help readers quickly grasp the main points of a document, book, 
                or meeting without needing to engage with the entire content. 
                This makes summaries invaluable for saving time and enhancing understanding in fast-paced environments.
